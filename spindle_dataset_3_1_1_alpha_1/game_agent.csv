Im Hörner- und Klauenstreit (1838) vertrat er ebenfalls als einer der Führer der Hornmänner die Konservativen. Ohne den Kampf gegen den Radikalismus aufzugeben, hatte er aber sein früheres polit.

Von 1852 bis 1877 war er selbständiger Redaktor dieser Zeitung. Ab den 1830er Jahren bis zu seinem Tod 1896 gab er den seit 1781 jährlich erscheinenden Züricher Kalender heraus. Ein weiterer Titel aus seinem Haus waren die Reisebegleiter für die Schweiz, die unter anderem Bahn- und Schiffsfahrpläne enthielten. Friedrich Bürklis Sammlung umfasst um die 1500 Titel. Bei etwa der Hälfte davon handelt es sich um orientalistische Fachliteratur des 19. Jahrhunderts, bei der anderen Hälfte um Drucke aus Europa, Ägypten und Indien in grösstenteils arabischer Sprache. Die Werke stammen von arabischen Autoren des 6. bis 16. Jahrhunderts und decken die Gebiete Grammatik, Lexikologie, islamisches Recht, islamische Theologie, Literatur und Geschichte ab (Wikipedia).","1",\N,\N,\N

When she was old enough, she travelled to Paris, where she met and married the intellectual Stanislas Pieczynski. In 1875 she followed him to Poland. Horrified by the lack of education of women there, she began at once to teach reading and writing. In 1881 she turned back to help people in Switzerland. In Leukerbad she learned from the American doctor and suffragette Harriet Clisby, who familiarized her with the women's rights movement. (Wikipedia)","4",\N,"67267456","0"

März 1826 als Sohn des Arztes Johann Jakob Heusser und der Dichterin Meta Heusser-Schweizer in Hirzel geboren. Heusser studierte zunächst Medizin an der Universität Zürich, danach Naturwissenschaften an der (späteren) Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, wo er 1851 promovierte. Danach war er im Privatlabor des Berliner Physikers und Chemikers Heinrich Gustav Magnus mit kristall-optischen Studien beschäftigt, die er 1852 bei Franz Ernst Neumann an der Universität Königsberg fortsetzte. 1853 wurde er als Privatdozent für Mineralogie an die Universität Zürich bestellt. Im Jahre 1856 unternahm Heusser im Auftrag der Kantone Zürich, Graubünden, Bern, Unterwalden, Glarus und Aargau eine Inspektionsreise nach Brasilien zur Überprüfung der Klagen von Schweizer Pächtern auf Plantagen bei São Paulo. Sein kritischer Bericht an die Zürcher Regierung führte zu einer Diskussion über die schweizerische Auswanderungspraxis. Ab 1859 lebte er in Buenos Aires, wo er als Geologe, Vermessungsingenieur und Landbesitzer tätig war. Heusser verfasste zahlreiche Aufsätze zur Geologie und Mineralogie Brasiliens, Argentiniens und der Schweiz sowie zur Auswanderung.

Jakob Christian Heusser, der 1871 Anna, geborene Smith, ehelichte, verstarb am 21. April 1909 in Buenos Aires. Er war der ältere Bruder von Johanna Spyri.

Heusser war seit 1851 mit dem Dichter Gottfried Keller befreundet. Im ersten Kapitel des Novellenzyklus Das Sinngedicht schildert Keller die Berliner Arbeitsumgebung seines Freundes im Magnus-Haus. ","3",\N,"77076564","1"
