Ein weiterer Titel aus seinem Haus waren die Reisebegleiter für die Schweiz, die unter anderem Bahn- und Schiffsfahrpläne enthielten. Friedrich Bürklis Sammlung umfasst um die 1500 Titel. Bei etwa der Hälfte davon handelt es sich um orientalistische Fachliteratur des 19. Jahrhunderts, bei der anderen Hälfte um Drucke aus Europa, Ägypten und Indien in grösstenteils arabischer Sprache. Die Werke stammen von arabischen Autoren des 6. bis 16.

Verlag Bär, Niederuzwil 2012. – cooperation with Zürich, Konstanz and Bern about the Burgrecht (1528) – special (new) interest in „development and change of state policies and institutions“ (Peyer, 1985), exclusion of legends and wonders from historiography for being “untrue” – constructs Reichsfreiheit of St. Gallen without documentation (!) with political interest and derives it from an important Kaiser (Barbarossa) and locates it as early as possible in time – the Swiss including the Innerschweitzer as immigrants (no continuency with the Helvetii) crossing the Rhein, governed by the empires since Charlmagne and liberated due to their merits (as a gift!) (Peyer, 1985) vs. panegyric of the liberation myth and Tell-Saga – respect towards monarchs and aristocrats, positive image of the Habsburg as “soft” not oppressing (!) – justifies the “verbürgerlichung” of the monastries with the degeneration of the nobel owners ans neglects the possibility that the nobility could be renovated – dislikes intervention in foreign affairs (not idea of neutrality but pragmatic self-protection), efforts for confessional peace == Vadian was not recognized. In his place, Johannes Stumpf became the leading historiographer (Peyer, 1985)","1",\N,\N,"WaJ1484"

Then she heard that he had been taken to Brussels and set out for the Belgian capital on foot, accompanied by her three children. Torrential rain soon drenched them as they trudged warily along the 20 miles of road. Martha had only a black silk dress and a light shawl, but reached the city with her children, found her husband safe there,, and gave birth to a baby girl on June 19. The joyful parents christened her Waterloo Deacon, after the previous day's victory. - See more at: http://www.historynet.com/napoleonic-wars-women-at-waterloo.htm#sthash.OzZZoItY.dpuf","1",\N,\N,"DeMxxxx"

Magdalene de Lancey later wrote an outstanding account of her experiences, which she called A Week at Waterloo in 1815. - See more at: http://www.historynet.com/napoleonic-wars-women-at-waterloo.htm#sthash.OzZZoItY.dpuf","1",\N,\N,"LaMxxxx"
